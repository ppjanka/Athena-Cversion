================================================================================
                              1-D problems
================================================================================

cpaw1d.c:
=========
Circularly Polarized Alfven Wave test of Toth.  This initializes only truly 1D
tests, that is wave must be in x1-direction only.

linear_wave1.c:
===============
Linear Wave convergence test.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D problems, but wave must be
grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis respectively.

shkset1.c:
==========
Shock Set -- initializes 1D Riemann problems.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D
problems, but shock must be grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis
respectively.

shu-osher.c
===========
Initializes 1D Riemann problem of Shu & Osher.  Only works in 1D (along x1).

twoibw.c:
=========
Two Interacting Blast Waves test of Woodward & Colella.  Can run 1D, 2D, or 3D
problems, but shock must be grid-aligned, i.e. along x1-, x2-, or x3-axis
respectively.


================================================================================
                              2-D problems
================================================================================

blast.c:
========

dmr.c:
======
Double Mach Reflection test of Woodward & Colella.  Only works for genuinely
2D problems in x1-x2 plane.

lw_implode.c:
=============
Liska & Wendroff implosion problem (Sod shocktube in a box).  Only works
for genuinely 2D problems in x1-x2 plane.

orszag-tang.c:
==============
Orszag & Tang MHD vortex problem.  Only works for genuinely 2D problems
in x1-x2 plane.

pgflow.c
========
"Planar Gravitational flow" test.  Sets up an analytic solution for a
steady flow in a periodic potential.  Code should hold this steady flow.
Good test of gravitational source terms, especially if flow is set at an
angle to grid.
